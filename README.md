Module 3 Homework challenge for Katherine Young

This homework assignment contains two folders, PyBank and PyPoll. Inside each folder are the sub-folders for Resources (containing the csv file of data) and Analysis (containing the text file output) and the main.py program. 

Each main.py program analyzes its respective csv file to collect the data specified in the assignment and then prints the required outputs in the terminal and generates a text file of the outputs in its respective Analysis folder.
